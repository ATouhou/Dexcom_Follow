# Dexcom_Follow
a library to connect to Dexcom Follow from a Esp32.  Derived from the python pyDexcom library.  

# Background
I'm a dad to a son with T1 Diabetes.  I wanted to explore the possibility of connecting to the dexcom follow API from low cost hardware.

I've included a simple example sketch to get you started.  I hope Someone somewhere finds this and puts it to use.  
I will when possible push updates as they come and work on improving the Dexcom follower class i've made here.

let me know if you've put it to good use or you have spotted a flaw.
